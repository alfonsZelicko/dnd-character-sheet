# DnD Character Sheet

This is my personal project where I'm experimenting with some libraries for the React framework,
particularly [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) and [MUI](https://mui.com/). Currently, the project is a simple
character sheet interface for DnD, and it's quite basic, with more features planned to be added gradually. Who knows
where itâ€™ll go from here! ðŸ˜Š

## Project Setup

- **Node Version**: 20.17
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

2. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    vite

3. Build a Chrome extension:
    ```bash
   vite build

... the Extension will be built into the {root}/dist folder -> this needs to be added into the Chrome as usually

Future Plans
As this project evolves, I may consider porting it to Electron for a desktop app experience. If youâ€™d be interested in
helping out with this transition, feel free to reach out!
